Network Packet Analyzer
This project is a simple Python-based packet sniffer designed for ethical use within your own network. It captures and analyzes network packets, providing insights into the traffic flowing through the network. The tool displays key information such as:

    Source IP Address
    Destination IP Address
    Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP)
    Payload Data (if available)

This tool is ideal for learning purposes, troubleshooting network issues, and understanding packet-level communication.
